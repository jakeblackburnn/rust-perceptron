# Rust Perceptron

Simple example of the perceptron machine learning algorithm written in rust. This project started as the final project of an amazing multi-topic programming class and was written in C. The current version is a re-work of a previous attempt to reproduce the project in rust. Most of the code is copied directly from this older version, with minor improvements.
