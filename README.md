# Rust Perceptron

Simple example of the perceptron machine learning algorithm written in rust. This project started as the final project of an amazing multi-topic programming class and was written in C. The current version is a re-work of a previous attempt to reproduce the project in rust. Most of the code is copied directly from this older version, with minor improvements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakeblackburnn/rust-perceptron.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-perceptron
   ```

---

## Usage

simply run the program using cargo:
```bash
cargo run
```

---

## Features

1. evaluate from user input - asks the user to provide a datapoint, and classifies it.

2. average performance evaluation - repeatedly trains and evaluates the model, calculating average performance of the algorithm on these data. (~81.5%)
